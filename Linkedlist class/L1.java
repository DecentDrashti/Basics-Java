linkedlist is almost identical to arraylist
Linkedlist vs ArrayList
they the interface of list class so syntax methods are same in both.
-The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it. When an element is added, it is placed into the array. If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.
~The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.

*Use an ArrayList for storing and accessing data, and LinkedList to manipulate(handle/control/edit/move) data.

#nodes
nodes are element of list. like we consider arrayindex in the array  for the single element like wise we consider nodes in linkedlist.

#head
it is 1st index element helps in iterator like the i alphbet works in the for loop
